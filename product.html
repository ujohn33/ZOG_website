										<h3>Integral role of wind energy generation</h3>
										<p>Energy industry is undergoing a major transition from fossil-based sources to renewable sources.
											Technology maturity, governement incentives and economies of scale enable further deployment of renewable generation. Furthermore,
										 	negative externalites in form of emissions become more integral to decision making and energy price formation. Notably, wind power
											has very low emissions levels (Saidur et al., 2011). Government polices have long recognized the importance of wind energy to energy
										 transition and carbon-free economies of the future. The Renewable Energy directive sets the following goals in front of countires - EU members</p>
											<ul>
												<li>The overall EU target for Renewable Energy Sources (RES) consumption by 2030 is 32%</li>
												<li>Member States must require fuel suppliers to supply a minimum of 14% of the energy consumed in road and rail transport by 2030 as renewable energy.</li>
												<li>Greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced by 40 per cent in 2030, relative to emissions in 1990</li>
											</ul>
										<p>To achieve these goals wind energy is projected to be growing in demand. There is more and more projects in offshore wind.
											 Wind energy is broadly classified as either onshore or offshore. Offshore wind energy has become an increasingly attractive option
											 due to the high energy potential associated with the vast offshore areas – winds are typically stronger and more stable at sea,
											 resulting in significantly higher production per unit installed.</p>
										<p>
											<span class="image right"><img class="image3" src="images/OPEX.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>
											Most of the current efforts and investments in the industry are much higher in bringing down the capital costs. The total expenditure over lifetime of the turbine spent
											operation and maintenance is estimated in the region 25% - 39% (BVG, 2014; Christine Röckmann et al, 2017). A significant share of this spending is allocated towards
											life cycle management (7%), inspective and preventive maintenace (22%), corrective maintenance (35%), technical upgrades and modifications (25%). This means there is
											a vast space for optimization and reductions in cost.
										</p>
										<p style="clear: both;">
											Although offshore wind technology has many similarities with wind energy on shore, it is still considered an immature industry. Offshore repairs are
											 estimated to be five to ten times more expensive than onshore repairs because the former are located further out into the sea where waters are quite deep.
											 Offshore repairs not only need expensive crane vessels, but they are also dependent on suitable weather conditions, which extends the waiting periods for repairs.
											 Research has shown that over the entire lifecycle of offshore wind farms, operations and maintenance (O&M) accounts for around 20-35 per cent of the
											 total cost (Shafiee, 2015a; Ortegon et al., 2013). Additionally, due to lack of flexibility and the limited availability of wind farms, O&M planning costs are
											 significantly higher offshore than onshore (Besnard et al., 2013; Esteban et al., 2011; Gundegjerde et al., 2015).
										</p>
										<h3>Product vision</h3>
										<p>Zog.Wind is a cloud-based decision-support system with offline usage functionality. It emplots algorithms that learn from the data collected at the wind turbine
												and provides the client with isights on underperformances and possibilities for optimization. The final output is a proposition of a maintenance plan, re-evaluated and
											  refined on stream. The product is conceptualized as a sublayer to an existing SCADA system. The final solution should be compatible with inputs from commonly used
												enterprise resource-planning (ERP) systems.
										</p>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/product_design.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>
											The solution takes the information on the health status from the existing monitoring systems in the windfarm. Our solution uses other types of stochastic data to
											forecast for additional external factors that influence the decision-amking. The final priority pecking order is formed and used for formulation of the optimal schedule
											and routing for the maintenace and crew transfer plan.

										</p>
										<h3>Competition</h3>
										<p>
											The offshore O&M industry is still immature and non-standardised. Most sites manage the scheduling with spreadsheets or SAP systems. These solutions are more time-consuming,
											provide no decision support and not built specifically to the needs of offshore O&M. More specialized tools like NOWIcob, O2M and ECN(TNO) have inefficient interfaces and
											are dependent on third-party software, MATLAB. In contrast, products like Shoreline and CHAMPS provide more user-friendly products but they don’t consider some important
											factors while building the output.
